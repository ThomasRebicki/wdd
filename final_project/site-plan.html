      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>One of the most common hobbies in BYUI is playing tabletop RPGs, the most
        popular of which being DnD. In order to play the game, usually there is a lot of “paperwork”
        to do. This is something that pushes away new players or players that do not have the time
        or energy for this extra home work. What if there was a website that could display and store
        documents, images and notes in an interactive way. This hub of documents could be edited
        and used by players, where one could set all the information they need for the game in an
        easy access layout. My idea is to build this hub where DnD players can post images and
        documents to their friends in a “newbie-friendly'' way.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is a tool for tabletop rpg players that aid them in world building, organization and display information to their group. This site will have simple tools and be designed primarily for new dungeon and dragon players and casual DnD groups. The aim of the website is to make the display of complex and numerous texts as simple as possible. So this website would also be perfect for players who don’t have the time or energy to dedicate for a mere game with friends. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
